# OATutor

OATutor is an Open-source Adaptive Tutoring System (OAT) based on Intelligent Tutoring System principles. It uses Bayesian Knowledge Tracing for skill mastery estimation and is implemented entirely in React JS with optional logging using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). 
The system can be deployed to git-pages without the use of any backend. For LMS integration, 
a middleware backend is required by Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI). Our [hosted backend server](https://cahlr.github.io/OATutor/#/posts/set-up-canvas-integration) can be used or the middleware can be launched independently. OATutor is Section 508 accessibility [compliant](https://cahlr.github.io/OATutor/static/documents/OATutor_Sec508_WCAG.pdf).
